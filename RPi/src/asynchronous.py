        Notes:
            process_id has to be set if several processes need bluetooth.
            For example: you want to use synchronization and consensus:
                - self.bluetooth.PROCESSES need to be 2
                - phase_consensus = Consensus(bluetooth, phase, process_id=0)

                - self.bluetooth.buffer size is 2 x len(self.bluetooth.RPIS_MACS)
                - Default: if self.bluetooth.PROCESSES is 0, you are not required to send bluetooth messages starting
                  with the process number.


            Each time self.bluetooth.send_message() is called, it should include the process number (ushort: 'H').
                - For example : self.bluetooth.send_message('<Hd', self.PROCESS, self.last_blink)
                - self.bluetooth.handle_client() will recognize the process that uses the buffer and place it in the
                  right row of self.bluetooth.buffer

            However, the process number will not be included into bluetooth.buffer.
                - Using above example: self.bluetooth.buffer will in the following structure: ['d', ..., 'd']
